Originally, I made this for fun and had been sitting in my documents for a month now, but I decided to transfer from a just single boomer HLDM mdl to Sven Co-op 5.0 and give it new surreal eerie background preview.

Just a bot who is very voracious for humans and animals and collects souls aftermath.

Main textures were taken from a awful poster of godawful good horror film.

I reskin this model from "Anubis" clan hl1 reskin instead of initial robo model and take its Chrome texture.
