| Arnold Schwarzenegger |
+-----------------------+
a Player model submission for the Haven o'Frags-Contest

1146 polygons
4 256x256 texture maps
The model was fitted onto drake's bone-skeleton
No custom animations included
A preview picture for the character selection menue is provided.

This model was inspired by Arnold as an action movie star in general and is not
related to a special movie but rather merged from several ones. So i decided to 
completely create his clothing on my own. To make his face more recognizeable, 
i scrapped some sunglasses i originally made to give him the typical Terminator-
look.

If you want to contact me through ICQ, please give me a hint of who you are, e.g.
note the haven o'frags contest. I normally ignore those "Hi"-authorisation-requests.

Ok, i stop babbling now :-D



Addendum: an assignement-bug on both hands was fixed so the left forearm no longer gets f**ed up in aiming anims. I looked at some of the oficial AHL player models and saw this flaw aswell, so i thought it was a bug in the original biped animation.
